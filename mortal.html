        <br>When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City,
         she hardly expects to witness a murder― much less a murder committed by three teenagers 
         covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears

            and Clary herself is attacked by a demon.<br><br> But why would demons be interested

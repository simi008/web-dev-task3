        <br>The Kings of Carnage clubhouse is no place for a good girl, but I’m not the good girl they envision.
        After getting tangled up in Carnage business, it isn’t long before I'm tangled up in their sheets.<br><br>
        All they see is my blonde hair and sweet smile and they want to dirty me up a little.
        I'm a splash of pink within the leather-clad army, standing out like a tampon in a condom factory.
        But it’s not my fault they underestimated me.<br><br>
        I might like girly things but I’m much more likely to spray you with bullets then sprinkle you with glitter.
        I could just tell them they have me labeled all wrong.
        But then, where’s the fun in that?<br><br>

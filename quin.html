        <br>I should warn you, I'm not a good person.<br><br>

        I tried to be good... normal.<br><br>
        
        But the darkness can’t be suppressed forever.<br><br>
        
        Six years ago, I walked away from the family. Now, I must go back.
         I have no choice. But things will be different this time. I’m stronger, smarter, 
         and I refuse to submit in a world ruled by dangerous men.<br><br>
        
        My name is Maura Quinn. I'm the Banphrionsa—Princess in my father’s dark kingdom of crime.
         Everyone has a story. Even the bad guy. So proceed with caution because this is 
         my descent or my rise. It depends on how you look at it. But most of all,
          this is how I embrace the darkness.<br><br>

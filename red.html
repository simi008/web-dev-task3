        <br>This is a world divided by blood—red or silver. The Reds are commoners, ruled by a Silver
        elite in possession of god-like superpowers.<br><br> And to Mare Barrow, a seventeen-year-old Red girl
        from the poverty-stricken Stilts, it seems like nothing will ever change. That is until she 
        finds herself working in the Silver Palace.<br><br> Here, surrounded by the people she hates the most,
        Mare discovers that, despite her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own. One that
        threatens to destroy the balance of power. Fearful of Mare's potential, the Silvers hide her
        in plain view, declaring her a long-lost Silver princess, now engaged to a Silver prince. 
        <br><br>Despite knowing that one misstep would mean her death, Mare works silently to help the Red
        Guard, a militant resistance group, and bring down the Silver regime.<br><br> But this is a world
        of betrayal and lies, and Mare has entered a dangerous dance—Reds against Silvers, prince 
        gainst prince, and Mare against her own heart.

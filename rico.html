        <br>"They should all be afraid of me now"<br><br><br>

        An assassin.<br>
        A psychopath.<br>
        A complete mess.<br><br>
        
        I’ve been called all of those and worse.
        Somebody once told me that one bad chapter doesn't mean your story is over.
        Mine was just starting.<br><br>
        Painting me as the villain of the story and destroying everything I held dear was an easy task for them.
        It was easy for him.
        But the rules of the game have changed, and this time I was going to make them pay.<br><br><br>
        
        My name is Ophelia Aster, a girl they threw away, a girl they wanted to shatter.<br>
        They thought trapping me would set them free, but they didn’t know that the girl they used to know, didn’t exist anymore.<br>
        They threw me into the darkness, so darkness was what I became.<br>

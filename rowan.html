        <br>For over three hundred years, Arden's very existence has been hidden.
         Until one night, when the latest assassination attempt fails and the third
          Killian blade makes its appearance.<br><br>

        A powerful witch with little knowledge of her heritage, 
        Arden's first step on the path of destiny is The Abbey. 
        A place of sanctuary and power, it's a haven in a sea of
         unknowns and where she hopes to find an ally.<br><br>
        
        An Elven prince, a Fae lord, the First Vampire, a warlock,
         and the King of Dragons make up the Imperium Cadre, one of
          the most powerful cadres in existence. Owning and managing
           The Abbey for over a thousand years, they're not known for taking in strays. 
           But Lord Theron's life debt paves Arden's entry into the formidable sphere of
            their protection.<br><br>
        
        As the sweeping winds of change blow, Arden and the cadre will navigate the
         path of destiny together. Secrets are revealed, heritage found, and alliances forged and lost.<br><br>

        <br>For thirty-five girls, the Selection is the chance of a lifetime.<br><br>
        The opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. <br>
        To be swept up in a world of glittering gowns and priceless jewels.<br>
        To live in a palace and compete for the heart of gorgeous Prince Maxon.<br><br>
        But for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare.
        It means turning her back on her secret love with Aspen, who is a caste below her.
        Leaving her home to enter a fierce competition for a crown she doesn't want. 
        Living in a palace that is constantly threatened by violent rebel attacks.<br><br>
        
        Then America meets Prince Maxon.<br><br> Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she's made
        for herselfâ€”and realizes that the life she's always dreamed of may not compare to a future
        she never imagined.

        <br>Meet Celaena Sardothien.<br><br>

        Beautiful. Deadly. Destined for greatness.<br><br>
        
        In a land without magic, where the king rules with an iron hand, Celaena, an assassin,
         is summoned to the castle. She comes not to kill the king, but to win her freedom.<br><br>
        If she defeats twenty-three killers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she is released
         from prison to serve as the king’s champion.<br><br>
        
        The Crown Prince will provoke her.
        The Captain of the Guard will protect her.<br>
         But something evil dwells in the castle of glass—and it’s there to kill. 
         When her competitors start dying one by one, Celaena’s fight for freedom
        becomes a fight for survival, and a desperate quest to root out the evil
         before it destroys her world.
